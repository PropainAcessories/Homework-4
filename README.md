🐓 This was a challenging assignment

🐓I had to Re-do my markup a few times for the DOM to load the pages, forms, and
    scores

🐓It is a dynamic app with 8 questions that punishes you by knocking off 5
    seconds for every wrong answer

🐓It will record your scores in a numerical list that you can look at
    and clear any time

🐓Compare scores with your friends, and feel free to laugh at my answers.

🐓 I experimented with several ways to try to do several things before i got a 
    working solution

🐓Many tabs of MDN, W3, github, stack overflow, and other random websites
    from my google adventures.
